- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KenBMET
- I'm a Cyber Security Student at Gwinnett Technical College in Georgia
- I'm a retired USAF Vet and a Biomedical Equipment Repair Technician with 30 years of experience 
- The majority of IT experience I have is on the hardware side.  
- With the increase of medical equipment becoming part of the IoT, it is more critical that the equipment and the networks the equipment operate on become more secure.
